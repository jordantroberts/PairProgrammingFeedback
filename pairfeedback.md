#Pairing Feedback

Feedback I have received from various pairing partners after pair programming sessions whilst studying at Makers Academy. I will use this feedback to become a better programmer and work towards the goal of helping my teams succeed and growing collaboratively.

"I really enjoyed our pairing session today, I think we worked well together and at a steady pace. As a driver you were able to listen and absorb instructions/suggestions which was reflected with the clean code you were writing. When I wasn't so sure on the next step you were able to clearly explain to me what direction you were taking and why. As a navigator, again, the communication was smooth and I was able to write correct syntax with your input. We were both learning as we went along so there isn't much constructive criticism regarding any negatives, I felt we were on a very similar level and worked well together to try and figure out steps that we were stuck on. Even figuring out the best way to work on the same repository, we paired well to find a solution!"

"Very supportive and patient. Made me feel very at ease both asking you questions and whilst exploring tangents I went off on.  You helped me a lot by not putting your personal progression in front of me being behind.  Discussions together really helped me solidify my knowledge and understanding of concepts. Helped me remember to always feature test first.  Really enjoyed it and you helped me learn a lot!!!! Thank you Jordan Roberts!!"

"Jordan is a patient pair partner, who works efficiently even under the pressure of challenging task. I loved that we didn’t forget to communicate while we were trying to find different ways to approach the problem.   Also I think it’s great that Jordan knew when to ask for a help when needed/when to take break, which can be easily ignored under difficult situations as often people just want to push more. It was tough task but I feel that I was able to learn a lot from Jordan’s view/approach on it."
